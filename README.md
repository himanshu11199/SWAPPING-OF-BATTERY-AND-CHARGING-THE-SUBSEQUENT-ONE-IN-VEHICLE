# SWAPPING-OF-BATTERY-AND-CHARGING-THE-SUBSEQUENT-ONE-IN-VEHICLE
ENERGY CAN NEITHER BE CREATED NOR DESTROYED‚Äù as per the thermodynamics law. We are trying to harness the maximum energy from secondary power sources (solar). 
In conventional electric vehicles there is only single accumulator which charges through electricity on wall and also the car operates from the same accumulator.
This results in low range and need to search for charging station even in some electric vehicle they add solar to charge batteries while vehicle is moving, 
it causes inefficient charging and heating of batteries. Thus, we developed a switching circuit working model which employs two batteries. 
One is used for the traction system of the car and the other battery is charged from the secondary source (solar panels), 
Once the battery for traction system reaches a battery percentage of less than 20% the system automatically switches to the other battery for traction motor 
and the drained battery starts to charge from the secondary source this happens on board while vehicle running on road. We designed the circuit with a sensor 
which constantly monitors the battery voltage along and the controller gets the battery percentage data and performs accordingly
